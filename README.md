# Development Economics

Data cleaning, handling, and analysis done in my university course on development economics. I focused on a survey provided by the World Bank on Nigeria. The data can be found on their website (https://data.worldbank.org/country).

The four files about househods, individual characteristics, individual education, and labor are code to clean the data from the survey. The file empirical assignment is where I analyze the clean data.

Some of the main findings of the analysis can be found here:

The weighted average age is only 23.99 years. The distribution is positively skewed. Hence, the median age is even lower than the average age, namely 19 years.

Men on average have 5.6 years of schooling, while women only have 3.85 years of schoolign. This leaves us with an education gap of 1.45.

However, as one can see from the table below, the younger generations are increasingly getting more education. Of the people in the age range of 15-25, almost half has completed secondary education.

The weighted average hours worked per week is 41.85. The median is at 42 hours. One can also see, that the amount of people working more than 55 hours per week is considerable.

Two regressions were run on the data to figure out what drives differences in wages. Education seems to be a rather big factor, as well as sex. The wage is negatively affected if an individual is self-employed or lives in a rural area.
